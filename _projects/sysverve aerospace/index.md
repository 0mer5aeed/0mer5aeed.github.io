title: Stepper Motor Control By RF
description: While working at Sysverve Aerospace, I was assigned to develop a wireless motion control system for small-scale actuator applications in UAVs. The challenge was to wirelessly control a NEMA17 stepper motor using RF communication, which required translating received signals into precise motion commands. I used an Arduino microcontroller to interpret incoming RF data and convert it into accurate pulse and direction signals required by the stepper driver. This ensured smooth, real-time control of the motor without relying on a wired interface. The system was successfully tested for responsiveness and reliability, demonstrating consistent motor behavior across varying distances and signal conditions. This project enhanced my expertise in wireless communication protocols, real-time motor control, and low-level hardware interfacingâ€”critical areas in aerospace and robotics development.
