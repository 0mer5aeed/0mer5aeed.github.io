title: Motor Controlled Bionic Hand
description: For my semester project, I designed and developed a functional bionic hand aimed at replicating natural finger movement using EMS (electromyographic) signals. The challenge was to create a lightweight yet durable prosthetic solution that could respond accurately to muscle signals for intuitive control. I used five small geared motors—one for each finger—to enable independent and precise motion. The structure of the hand was 3D printed using PLA material, chosen for its high strength-to-weight ratio, making the device both lightweight and mechanically robust. EMS sensors were integrated to detect muscle signals, which were then processed to control motor actuation, mimicking real hand gestures. This project not only showcased my skills in biomechanics, motor control, and sensor integration but also deepened my understanding of user-centered design in assistive technology. The result was a responsive, cost-effective prototype that demonstrated strong potential for real-world prosthetic applications.
