title: High Power Current Sensor
description: While working with Smart Monitoring Solutions, UK, I was responsible for developing a compact and high-efficiency six-layer PCB that integrated an STM32 microcontroller with a Raspberry Pi to create a powerful embedded tracking solution. The objective was to deliver a real-time, multi-channel tracking system for use in transportation, asset monitoring, and security applications. I enabled seamless communication with GPS, GSM, and GNSS modules, ensuring reliable global positioning and remote data access. The PCB was carefully designed in Altium with a strong emphasis on high-reliability signal routing, robust power distribution, and modular expandability to support future scalability. By aligning the hardware design with long-term product strategy and cross-industry requirements, I contributed directly to the development of a functional prototype that demonstrated global object tracking capability. This prototype formed the foundation of a commercial-grade solution and highlighted my ability to blend embedded systems engineering with strategic product vision.
