title: High Power Current Sensor
description: During my time at Zambeel Machine Craft, I developed a high-resolution current sensor tailored for high-power applications where precise measurement and durability were critical. The goal was to design a solution capable of accurately monitoring current under extreme load conditions. I engineered a complete working prototype using a shunt resistor and an external ADC to improve measurement accuracy beyond the limits of typical internal ADCs. The custom PCB was designed in Altium with a strong focus on ruggedness and thermal reliability. To complement the hardware, I created a user-friendly graphical interface using LabVIEW, which enabled real-time data monitoring, live calibration, and interactive control. The system was validated through extensive lab stress testing and demonstrated exceptional reliability and precision. This project not only delivered a scalable and field-ready solution but also strengthened client trust through its robust performance and professional-grade interface.
