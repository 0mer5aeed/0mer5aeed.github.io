title: SheetMetal manufacturing 
description: While working at Metal Master, I was tasked with designing a rainwater head that would be both functional and manufacturable using Colorbond metal sheets. The goal was to create a durable, weather-resistant component that could be efficiently produced using existing fabrication processes. I used SolidWorks to develop the design through precise sheet metal CAD modeling, ensuring correct bend allowances, fit, and drainage geometry. The model was optimized for manufacturing by accounting for material behavior during folding and cutting operations. I collaborated with the production team to align the design with CNC turret punching and metal bending capabilities, ensuring seamless transition from digital model to physical product. The result was a well-constructed, easy-to-install rainwater head that met both aesthetic and structural requirements. This project strengthened my skills in sheet metal design, CAD for manufacturing, and real-world design validation through close coordination with fabrication teams.
